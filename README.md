# Robotics projects

## 1) AR_Robot will be a basic navigation autonomous robot with its main function being to be able to navigate around an area

Notes for myself: 

1) Start taking notes of all the dependencies that this project will have.
	Adafruit libraries that controls the motors
	ROS
	Python packages
	C++ packages
	
2) Start thinking on how to create a ansible playbook.


3) For the navigation capabiltiies and object detections side of the project: 
	-Start testing the camera ralsense D400 and if this is going to work with the raspberry pi
	-Play with the realsense wrappers and get a good idea of how the cameras can be implemented on object detections
	-Wrap the cameras modules with the displacement modules, such as the motors movement and program I put together already
	-Tune the whole system
